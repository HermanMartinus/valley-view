### How to get here from Johannesburg/Pretoria by car:
 
a) A quicker route but with more toll gates! Take the N4 to Nelspruit, the R40 towards White River and turn off towards Sabie on the R537.  At Sabie follow the R532 to Graskop and at the Pilgrim's Rest junction you will see brown road signs to Valley View Backpackers.  At the first four-way stop, turn right up the hill and down to the valley, turn left and we are number 47 on the corner on the left.

b) A more scenic but longer route! Take the N4 to Belfast, turn off and follow the R540 to Dulllstroom (nice arts & crafts/fishing area) until you get to Lydenburg PLEASE NOTE also signposted as 'MASHISHING'. Head for Pilgrim's Rest on the R533 (ask if you get confused with the absence of signs!) and then follow the above instructions to get to Valley View Backpackers once you have passed the Sabie junction.

### How to get here from Hazy View or the Panorama Route (R532) by car:

From Graskop town take the road towards Sabie and Pilgrim's Rest.  Turn left at the first four-way stop out of town and follow the brown road signs to Valley View Backpackers.

### Public Transport from Johannesburg/Pretoria to Nelspruit:

You can take a direct City Bug shuttle from O.R Tambo Intl airport to Nelspruit (BP garage Sonpark) which costs R370 (one way) and takes approx 3.5 hours.  Call 086 133 4433 or visit their website www.citybug.co.za for timetables and reservations.  There are usually four shuttle buses a day.  Alternatively take the Lowveld Link shuttle from the airport which passes Pretoria and then on to Nelspruit (The Crossings Tourist Information) which costs R350 (one way) and takes approx. 3.5 hours.  Call +27 (0)13 7501174 or 083 778 8527 or visit their website www.lowveldlink.com.  There is one shuttle bus a day. Bushveld Link runs a service which costs R330 (one way) from Pretoria, Midrand and O.R. Tambo airport to Sabie (Engen garage) and Hazyview, which leaves the airport on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 12.15/30pm. Call (0)13 750 1953 or 083 284 5382.   If you wish to travel from the main bus station in Johannesburg/Pretoria, then there are several bus companies who travel to Nelspruit; City to City / Translux, Greyhound, Intercape and Citiliner.  Please visit their websites (on Google search) for timetables and prices as these can vary from day to day, including the journey times.

### Getting from Nelspruit to Graskop:

You can either contact us for a transfer (please see our website rates) or take a mini bus taxi from the centre of town (near the Police station) to Hazy View and then take a connecting mini bus taxi from Hazy View to Graskop, which costs approx R50 in total.  This trip can take several hours as the drivers wait for the mini bus to fill before moving on.  At times it is possible to get to Sabie but there is less transport going from Sabie to Graskop (better made in larger groups) although this service appears to be improving greatly.
